The goal of this Kaggle competition is:
Given driver images, each taken in a car with a driver doing something in the car (texting, eating, talking on the phone, makeup, reaching behind, etc), predict the likelihood of what the driver is doing in each picture.

c0: safe driving
c1: texting - right
c2: talking on the phone - right
c3: texting - left
c4: talking on the phone - left
c5: operating the radio
c6: drinking
c7: reaching behind
c8: hair and makeup
c9: talking to passenger

Dataset size - 102,150 images divided into training and test data.
Dataset file size - 4GB

The accompanying CSV file outlining the image list is also uploaded in this bucket.
